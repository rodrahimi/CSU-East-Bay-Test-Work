##1)
```{r}

library(resampledata)
data("GSS2002")

index <- which(is.na(GSS2002$Gender) | is.na(GSS2002$DeathPenalty))
gender <- GSS2002$Gender[-index]
postlife <- GSS2002$DeathPenalty[-index]

n <- length(postlife)
n_f <- sum(gender == 'Female')
n_m <- sum(gender == 'Male')
# sample proportion of females that believe in afterlife:
phat_f <- sum(gender == 'Female' & postlife == 'Favor') / n_f
# sample proportion of males that believe in afterlife:
phat_m <- sum(gender == 'Male' & postlife == 'Favor') / n_m
# pooled sample proportion
phat <- sum(postlife == 'Favor') / n

SE <- sqrt(phat_f*(1-phat_f)/n_f + phat_m*(1-phat_m)/n_m)
ci_l <- phat_f - phat_m - 1.96 * SE
ci_u <- phat_f - phat_m + 1.96 * SE
round(c(ci_l, ci_u), 3)


#We are 95 percent confident that the population portion of females that are in favor of the dead penalty is between .176 and .077 lower than the population portion of males that are in favor of the death penalty 
```


#2 a)
```{r}
index <- which(is.na(GSS2002$Education) | is.na(GSS2002$SpendMilitary))
edu <- GSS2002$Education
military <- GSS2002$SpendMilitary

table(edu,military)

```
##b)
```{r}
prop.table(table(edu, military), margin = 1)
```
#based on the row of proporions it seems as though there seems to be a relationship between eduction and position on government spending on military. (usually trending lower as edu goes up at each level of military level)

## c)

```{r}
set.seed(999)
chisq2 <- chisq.test(edu, military); chisq2
```

##ho: edu and milatry are independent
##ha: edu and military are dependent

##based on a pavlue of less than .001 we reject the null hypothesis and have evidence to indicate that education and miliatrey are not independent of one another have some sort of relationship with one another.

##d)
```{r}
chisq2$expected
```
##yes they are met as they are greater than 5
